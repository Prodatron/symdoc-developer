The SymShell system application provides a program environment with a text
based user interface. Applications, which are working inside the SymShell
environment, can use terminal input and output routines for sending and
receiving text data to and from the standard console or another redirected
source and destination.
SymShell commands are triggered via a message, which has to be sent with RST
#10 (MSGSND) to the SymShell process. SymShell will pass its process ID and the
text screen resolution to the application via the command line.

SYMSHELL COMMAND LINE INFORMATION

Library:    SyShell_PARALL
            SyShell_PARSHL

SymShell passes three information via the command line, when the application
has been started inside SymShell.

A command line usually looks like this:

[drive:/path/filename.com] (user parameter list)

The 256 byte string is always placed behind the last byte of the code memory
area of a loaded application (see the "applications" chapter). SymShell appends
an additional parameter, when executing an application:

[drive:/path/filename.com] (user parameter list) %spPPXXYYVV

As you can see the SymShell-based application has to search for a paameter,
which always starts with "%sp". If there is no option like this, the
application probably hasn't be started inside SymShell and should quit itself
at once, as it can't use the text terminal features. If such an option can be
found, it contains a few information. All three numbers are in ASCII format and
represent 2 decimal digits for each value:
PP -> number of the SymShell process. This is important, as the application
      has to know the number of the process, to which it has to send the
      commands for text input and output.
XX -> width of the text terminal window in chars.
YY -> height of the text terminal window in chars. These two infos maybe used
      for text output reformatting.
VV -> SymShell version; first digit is the major, second is the minor version

Example:
c:\symbos\symshell\quizgame %level:9 %sp07602021
The application "quizgame.com" will be executed in path "c:\symbos\symshell\".
The user passed the parameter "%level:9" to it. The version of SymShell is 2.1,
it runs with process ID 7, and the text terminal window has a size of 60x20
chars.

Message:        00  1B  064
                01  1B  channel (0=Standard, 1=Keyboard)
Description:    Requests a char from an input source. The input source can be
                the standard channel or the console keyboard. Usually the
                standard channel is the console keyboard, too, but it can also
                be a textfile or another source, if redirection or piping is
                active.
                If the keyboard is used, SymShell waits for the user and won't
                send a response as long as no key is pressed.

                              its text terminal environment)
                        Any other: See "Error Codes" in chapter "File Manager"
Description:    If a char could be received from the keyboard, a file or
                another source, it will be sent to the application via this
                response message. If the user pressed Control+C or if the end
                of the file (EOF) has been reached, the EOF flag will be set.

                02  1B  destination buffer ram bank (0-15)
                03  1W  destination buffer address
Description:    Requests a string from an input source. The input source can be
                the standard channel or the console keyboard. Usually the
                standard channel is the console keyboard, too, but it can also
                be a textfile or another source, if redirection or piping is
                active.
                The maximum lenght of a string is 255 chars, so the buffer must
                have a size of 256 bytes (255 + terminator). A string is always
                terminated by 0.
                If the keyboard is used, SymShell waits until the user typed in
                a text line and pressed the Return key.

Description:    If a text line could be received from the keyboard, a file or
                another source (terminated by 13/10), it will be sent to the
                application via this response message. If the user pressed
                Control+C or if the end of the file (EOF) has been reached, the
                EOF flag will be set.

                can be the standard channel or the console text screen. Usually
                the standard channel is the console text screen, too, but it

                screen, too, but it can also be a textfile or another
                destination, if redirection or piping is active.
                A string has always to be terminated by 0. The lenght, which
                has to be specified, must not include the 0-terminator.

                        1 = application releases focus and goes into blur mode
Description:    The application informs SymShell about an exit event.
                If an application quits itself, SymShell has to be informed
                about that, so that it can remove the application from its
                internal management table. In this case the exit type has to be
                0 ("quit").
                If an application doesn't require the focus inside the text
                terminal anymore, it has to send exit type 1 ("blur"). The
                background is, that SymShell can run multiple applications in
                the same text terminal at the same time. User text inputs will
                only be sent to the application which has been started at first
                until it releases the focus and goes into blur mode. In this
                case the next application or the command line interpreter of
                the shell itself will receive the focus (the user can force the
                shell to get back focus at once by appending "&" at the end of
                the command line).

                07  1B  pathes ram bank (0-15)
Description:    Adds a path component to a base path. The base path can be the
                current one, where the application has been started from, or
                another defined path. It should not end with a "/".
                The added path component can even start at the root directory
                or is consisting of a complete stand-alone path.
                Examples:
                base: "c:\symbos\apps", add: "..\music\mp3\lalala.mp3"
                   -> "c:\symbos\music\mp3\lalala.mp3"

                SymShell will return some useful information about the new
                path. You will receive the position of the 0-terminator as well
                as the position of the last "/" in the path. It may also be
                usefull to know, if the file at the end of the path contains

SYMSHELL TEXT TERMINAL CONTROL CODES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The text terminal control codes are partially CPC-OS compatible. There are
additional codes for enabling a wide range of additional terminal emulations.
Please note, that the cursor position is 1-based, so the first line and the
first column have the coordinates 1/1. Codes 01, 07, 15 and 27 are not yet
defined and will be ignored.
